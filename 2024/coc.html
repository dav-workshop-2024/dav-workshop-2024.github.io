    <h2>Code of Conduct<br></span><br></h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                The Workshop on Deep Learning-aided Verification (DAV) takes questions of diversity, equity, and inclusion seriously.
                Our code of conduct closely follows the code of conduct of the established machine learning conference (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct).
                With their attendance, all participants of the workshop agree with this Code of Conduct during the event.
                Cooperation from all participants is expected to provide a safe and productive environment that respects the inherent worth of every person.
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    Participants commit to providing an environment free from harassment, bullying, or discrimination.
                    This includes (taken from https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct) offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, and expression, age,
                    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), politics, technology choices,
                    or any other personal characteristics. Bullying, intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                    and behavior that interferes with another participant's full participation will not be tolerated. This includes sexual harassment, stalking,
                    following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, public vulgar exchanges,
                    and diminutive characterizations. Potential sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct.
                </ul>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    If a participant engages in such behavior, the workshop organizers may take action ranging from a formal warning to expulsion from the workshop.
                    Please email the workshop organizers immediately if you observe or experience such behavior. A response of "just joking" will not be accepted.
                </ul>
                </p>
